# 🏫 RIT Tracker  

**Smart Campus Navigation System**  

## 📌 Overview  
RIT Tracker is a web-based navigation tool designed to help students, visitors, and faculty easily locate buildings, classrooms, and facilities within our campus. It integrates **satellite imagery** and an **interactive 3D AR view**, providing a seamless navigation experience similar to Google Street View.  

## ❓ Problem Statement  
Navigating the campus can be challenging for students and visitors. Finding classrooms, offices, and essential facilities is often confusing, and there is no centralized system for accessing real-time information. RIT Tracker aims to solve this by providing an intuitive **smart navigation system** with **satellite mapping** and **3D walkthroughs** for easy location discovery.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🌍 **Satellite View**: Displays campus boundaries using **Google Maps API**.  
- 🏢 **3D AR Indoor View**: Uses **Plannellum** to create an interactive walkthrough of the CS building.  
- 📌 **Easy Access**: No installation required—just open the web app.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **3D AR Framework**: [Plannellum](https://github.com/jgcasta/plannellum)  
- **Maps & Satellite Imagery**: [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps)
